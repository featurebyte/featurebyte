FeatureByte’s Feature Discovery is designed to further support data scientists in their feature engineering work.

While:

* the Data Semantics annotation informs them on the nature of data
* the Declarative Framework unleashes their creativity
* and the Feature Store helps them reuse features and quickly push their new features into production,

Feature Discovery helps them uncover features with signals that may not have been captured yet.

### Core Principles

The development of the Feature Discovery is governed by the following principles:

* only meaningful features should be suggested. Data Scientists should not be overwhelmed by a large number of noisy features
* suggestions should follow feature engineering best practices
* suggestions should not miss important signals

To achieve this, Feature Discovery is built as a rule-based tool that:

* relies on the data semantics. If no data semantics are annotated to the data, no suggestion is raised
* codifies the best practices for those semantics
* automatically joins data
* searches features for entities related to the main entity
* is easily extensible by the data scientist for internal usage or by FeatureByte’s community.


### Discovery Outputs

Feature Discovery can be triggered from:

* a use case
* a view and an entity
* or a view column and an entity

Feature Discovery results are in the form of feature recipe methods organized by theme that encapsulates information on the feature entity, main data, and signal type.

The results for a Feature Discovery triggered from an Event Timestamp of a Credit Card transaction table for the Transaction Entity would be as follows:

	Transaction / Credit Card Transaction / Timing:
 		Transaction_Hour_of_Day
		Transaction_Day_of_Week
		Transaction_Month

	Transaction / Credit Card Transaction / Similarity:
	  based on Hour_of_Day
		Transaction_Hour_of_Day_Rel_Freq_vs_Card_Transaction_Count_History
		Transaction_Hour_of_Day_Rel_Freq_vs_Card_Transaction_Amount_History
		Transaction_Hour_of_Day_Rel_Freq_vs_Customer_Transaction_Count_History
		Transaction_Hour_of_Day_Rel_Freq_vs_Customer_Transaction_Amount_History
		Transaction_Hour_of_Day_Rel_Freq_vs_Merchant_Transaction_Count_History
		Transaction_Hour_of_Day_Rel_Freq_vs_Merchant_Transaction_Amount_History
	  based on Day_of_Week

		Transaction_Day_of_Week_Rel_Freq_vs_Merchant_Transaction_Count_History
		Transaction_Day_of_Week_Rel_Freq_vs_Merchant_Transaction_Amount_History

To convert the recipes into a feature, users can call the feature recipe method directly from the use case, the view and or the view column.

Help is provided to inform on:

* some required parameters such as the feature window
* the code that could be alternatively used to create the feature in the SDK

### Human-in-the-Loop Mode

Feature Discovery combines multiple steps: Joins, Transforms, Subsetting, Aggregations, and Post Aggregation Transforms.

Users can choose to decompose those steps and get suggestions at the step level only.

### Discovery Engine

The search for features is based on the data field semantics, the nature of the data and whether the entity is the primary (or natural) key of the data.

The feature recipes are the results of a series of joins, transforms, subsets, aggregations, and post aggregation transforms.

* Transform recipes are selected based on the data field semantics and their outputs have new semantics defined by the recipes.
* Subsetting is triggered by the presence of an `Event Type` field in the data.
* Aggregation recipes are selected in function of the nature of the data and entity and the semantics of the field and its transforms.
* Post Aggregation transforms recipes are selected based on the nature of the aggregations
