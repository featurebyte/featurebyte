    "\n",
    "<b>Feature primary entity:</b> The primary entity of a feature defines the level of analysis for that feature. \n",
    "When a feature is a result of an aggregation grouped by multiple entities, the primary entity is a tuple of those entities. For instance, if a feature quantifies the interaction between a customer entity and a merchant entity in the past, such as the sum of transaction amounts grouped by customer and merchant in the past 4 weeks, the primary entity is the tuple of customer and merchant.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a feature is derived for features with different primary entities, the primary entity is determined by the entity relationships, and the lowest level entity is selected as the primary entity. If the underlying entities have no relationship, the primary entity becomes a tuple of those entities. For example, if a feature compares the basket of a customer with the average basket of customers in the same city, the primary entity is the customer since the customer entity is a child of the customer city entity. However, if the feature is the distance between the customer location and the merchant location, the primary entity becomes the tuple of customer and merchant since these entities do not have any child-parent relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Feature List primary entity:</b> The main focus of a feature list is determined by its primary entity, which typically corresponds to the primary entity of the Use Case that the feature list was created for.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the features within the list pertain to different primary entities, the primary entity of the feature list is selected based on the entities relationships, with the lowest level entity chosen as the primary entity. In cases where there are no relationships between entities, the primary entity may become a tuple comprising those entities.\n",
    "To illustrate, consider a feature list comprising features related to card, customer, and customer city. In this case, the primary entity is the card entity since it is a child of both the customer and customer city entities. However, if the feature list also contains features for merchant and merchant city, the primary entity is a tuple of card and merchant.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Use Case primary entity:</b> In a Use Case, the primary entity is the object or concept that defines its problem statement. Usually, this entity is singular, but in cases such as the recommendation engine use case, it can be a tuple of entities that interact with each other."
