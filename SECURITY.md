## 🔐 Reporting Security Issues

> Please do not report security vulnerabilities via public issues, pull requests, or discussions!
> It is critical that security related issues are reported privately so we have time to address them before they become public knowledge.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us by sending an email to [it-admin[@]featurebyte.com](mailto:it-admin@featurebyte.com).

Please include as much of the information listed below to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Environment (e.g. Linux / Windows / macOS)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
