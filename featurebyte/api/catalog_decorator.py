    """
    Decorator to update the catalog and reset it back to original state if needed.

    If the calling catalog object has the same ID as the global state, we will just call the function that is being
    decorated.
    If not, this decorator will temporarily update the global catalog state to the catalog_id of the calling catalog
    object, call the decorated function, and then reset the state back.

    This is useful as an intermediate state for us to support a catalog object oriented syntax, while still maintaining
    a global state for the catalog ID at the implementation level.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func: Any
        Function to decorate

    Returns
    -------
    Any
