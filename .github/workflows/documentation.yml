# This workflow will check to see what diffs will be made to the documentation. If there are any, this will fail
# the check. This is to ensure that all changes that are being made to documentation are signed off by a developer.
# To sign off, or skip the documentation check, add
#   - Add 'Documentation Changes Confirmed' label to the PR
