# Changelog

## v0.4.0

### üõë Breaking Changes

+ `target` add basic API object for Target
  Initialize the basic API object for Target.
+ `feature-group` update the feature group save operation to use `/feature/batch` route

+ `deployment` Skip redundant updates of ONLINE_STORE_MAPPING table
+ `static-source-table` support materialization of static source table from source table or view
+ `catalog` Create target_table API object
  Remove default catalog, require explicit activation of catalog before catalog operations.
+ `feature-list` update feature list to preserve feature order
+ `target` Add gates to prevent target from setting item to non-target series.
+ `target` Add TargetNamespace#create
  This will allow us to register spec-like versions of a Target, that don't have a recipe attached.

+ `service` Refactor TileScheduler as a service
+ `target` stub out target namespace schema and models
+ `service` Add traceback to tile job log for troubleshooting

+ `feature` update feature & feature list save operation to use POST `/feature/batch` route
+ `service` Disable tile monitoring by default
+ `service` Fix listing of databases and schemas in Spark 3.2
+ `target` Refactor compute_target and compute_historical_feature
+ `feature` optimize time to deserialize feature model

+ `service` Implement TileRegistryService to track tile information in mongo persistent
+ `spark-session` add kerberos authentication and webhdfs support for Spark session
+ `service` Fix compatibility of string contains operation with Spark 3.2
+ `target` add CRUD API endpoints for Target
  First portion of the work to include the Target API object.
+ `target` Fully implement compute_target to materialize a dataframe
+ `service` Refactor info service by splitting out logic to their respective services.
  Most of the info service logic was not being reused. It also feels cleaner for each service to be responsible for its own info logic. This way, dependencies are clearer. We also refactor service initialization such that we consistently use the dependency injection pattern.
+ `online-serving` Use INSERT operation to update online store tables to address concurrency issues
+ `target` create target namespace when we create a target
+ `service` Fix more datetime transform compatibility issues in Spark 3.2
+ `storage` Add support for using s3 as storage for featurebyte service

  This will help us support materializing target tables in the warehouse.
