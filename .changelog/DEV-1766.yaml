  This bug was caused by the deployment enablement and disablement does not consider that the same
  feature list could be shared by multiple deployments. This meant that when any of the deployment
  was disabled, it will update the corresponding feature list `deployed` status to false and update
  data warehouse. A proper fix is to only update the feature list `deployed` status when all deployments
  using the feature list are disabled.
